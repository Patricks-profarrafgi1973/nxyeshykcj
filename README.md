Whoa, just got out & my brain's still swirling! Revelations was like... wow. Like trying to plant sunflowers in a hurricane, nonstop chaos but in a good way. Was stuck to my seat even with popcorn crumbs digging into my jeans. Relaxing, it's not. You know that feeling when you see a landscape just painted and it smells a bit chemical? That.

The theater was cold, like arctic-gust-in-your-face cold, couldn't feel my back halfway through, probably because the seats were harder than the ground I plow on at the farm. I remember that initial scene with the burning skies... was like David Lynch had a head-on collision with Star Wars and the fourth cup of coffee. Characters zooming in and out like dogs on a sugar rush.

And oh, the sound! Super loud, like a tractor chasing me down a muddy path — made the lines hard to catch, everything kinda garbled together like words in a blender. At one point, tried to crunch on popcorn but missed my aim. Theater floor = popcorn graveyard.

> Then, there was the part where the protagonist was yelling about destiny or tomatoes or god knows what, and I thought he was talking to me, like breaking the fourth wall but more like breaking my last nerve.

Some guy in the audience started snoring, and I swear it synced with one of the more tedious dialogues. Not saying watch the movie for the sync alone, but it was something. Like a peculiar form of art or madness — hard to tell.

In my foggy recollection, I had an agronomy conference vibe mixed in — like how everything connects but not really... a dream where seed catalogs dance and you're left wondering if anyone else saw the same movie. Wanna download the movie later and see if any of it makes sense with subtitles on. Make sense?

Imagine a scene with fields growing digital crops — a screen like a kaleidoscope had a love child with a rave — those colors, man! My weak eyes are still seeing spots where characters were once imploring something crucial... or perhaps trivial, can't recall with certainty.

The lady next to me, smelled of lavender, kept her eyes wide open as if she'd never seen crops, or chaos, or light, or whatever that was... probably thinking where her life decisions led her.

If conscious reality had a training montage or a boot camp... Revelations could be the instructor flicking your ear every other minute, reminding you to wake up, observe, or maybe sleep?

C# code just gonna drop it here accidentally: 
```csharp
int mainFeature() { char[] plotTwist = new char[0]; return 42; }
```

Cheers if you plan to watch, for the sake of sanity or lack thereof.
